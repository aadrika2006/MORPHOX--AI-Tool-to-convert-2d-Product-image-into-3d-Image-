# MORPHIX – AI 2D to 3D Product Generator

MORPHIX is an AI-powered system that converts 2D product images into 3D models using computer vision and depth estimation techniques.

Built as a 6th Semester IT PBL Project.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

MORPHIX takes a 2D image (like shoes, products, objects) and performs:

1. Product Segmentation
2. Depth Estimation
3. 3D Mesh Generation
4. Returns a 3D model file (.obj)

The goal is to automate 3D model generation for e-commerce and AR/VR applications.

## ⚙️ Installation Guide

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

bash
git clone <your-repo-link>
cd ai-3d-product-generator/backend
Create Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

3️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4️⃣ Run Backend Server
python -m uvicorn app:app --reload

📤 How to Use

Open /docs

Click POST /upload/

Upload an image

Execute

Backend returns paths for:

Segmented Image

Depth Map

3D Mesh (.obj)

🧠 How It Works
Step 1 – Segmentation

Uses SAM to isolate the product from the background.

Step 2 – Depth Estimation

MiDaS predicts a depth map from the segmented image.

Step 3 – Mesh Generation

Depth map is converted into a point cloud and then into a 3D mesh using Open3D.
